# Machine Learning Credit Risk Prediction  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **credit risk** using the German Credit dataset. The goal is to classify loan applicants as **low-risk** or **high-risk** based on demographic and financial attributes.  
By leveraging **machine learning models** and **data-driven insights**, the project provides a robust framework for credit scoring and risk assessment.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- ✅ Performed **data preprocessing** (missing value handling, encoding categorical variables, scaling).  
- ✅ Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Matplotlib & Seaborn to identify patterns in age, income, job, housing, savings, and credit amount.  
- ✅ Implemented multiple **ML algorithms** — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, KNN, and XGBoost.  
- ✅ Applied **GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization.  
- ✅ Evaluated models using **accuracy, confusion matrix, classification reports, and ROC-AUC curves**.  
- ✅ Identified **XGBoost** as the best-performing model with an accuracy of **66.7%**.
